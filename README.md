=================

#### What’s this?
Need to know the contents of the local DNS cache, yet don’t want to type in
`ipconfig /flushdns` every time into the Windows command prompt?

This batch file utilises that command and redirects its output into a file on
your desktop. It then opens that file with Notepad for you to quickly check the
DNS cache. When the Notepad window gets closed, the file gets deleted.

#### Instructions
1. Place this batch file anywhere on your Windows 10 machine, preferably on
   your Desktop for fast access
2. Double-click it
3. When you’re done reading the contents, simply close the file
